# Four_in_row_with_CPP
 A Small Game that I developed, it being a challenge to write code in 4 hours from a person who ignored playing that game with me..😏😅                   And, Yes, I did that in 4 Hours.🤩😎


As the Name itself describes, if there are four disks consecutively..game is over.

it is a multiplayer game in which each player chooses a color disk (Here it is alphabet, either G(GREEN) or R(RED)).
One who places manages to place Four disks consecutively, either horizontally or vertically or diagonally, is the winner.

Each time when a player chooses a column to insert disk, it is placed on top of the current disks in that column.

if a player tries to insert a disk in a column that is already full, then it is discarded considering it as invalid input and will be prompted for a valid input.

Finally, If entire board is occupied and still no-one wins then the match is considered to be DRAW MATCH.

It is very simple to develop, 
just if you 
  - have some patience.
  - be able to analyse how to take the input (checking its validity) 
  - and, manage to find the winner.
  
Try Coding it yourself, and if you are stuck at any point play the game practically with anyone for more clarity which makes easy to develop.

Happy Coding..:)
